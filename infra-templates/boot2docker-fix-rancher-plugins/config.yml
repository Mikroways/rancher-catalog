name: Boot2Docker Fix Rancher Plugins directory error
description: |
  Boot2Docker doesn't symlink /var/run to /run. Then they are different directories.
  Rancher agent assumes docker plugins are in /var/run/docker/plugins, but boot2docker looks for them
  at /run/docker/plugins, but as they are different within boot2docker, it doesn't work
